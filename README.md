**My Life, Journey, and Aspirations: A Reflective Summary**

Hi, I'm Mehrab Hossain Rahi, was born and raised in the only island district of Bangladesh, named Bhola. After completing my secondary school from there, I moved to the capital city Dhaka for better opportunities and edutation. I was admitted to Dhaka City College then and started exploring the new environment and culture of the captial. After completing my higher secondary school from there, I was preparing for my undergrads university entrance exams to get into a government funded university known as public universtiy, which were very competitive exams! Unfortunately I failed to be placed in the required merit position in those exams were not enough to get the oppurtunities.

During the time I started exploring different things on internet and discovered myself interested business & entrepreneurship. afterward I started brainstorming about choosing the industry, where I would like to contribute and pursue my entrepreneurial journey. On that time I have learned that scalability is a major indicator to build a large enterprise, and technology or to be more specific SAAS has the oppurtunities to scale a company very fast compared to other industries. Besides, in this industry, starting a business required comparatively less initial capital to other industries. So I decided to choose this industry to pursue my entrepreneurial journey. But there was a serious concern that would I be interested and qualified enough to adjust myself in this industry. To find those two answers I decided to do a deep dive into it.

After my entrance exams session had over and I was not succeed to get into any public universtiy and my family asked me that what I would like to do afterward. I said to them that I would like to pursue my higher education in computer science & engineering and they agreed with me. Then I decided to enroll in Daffodil International University for my bachelor's in CSE, and got admitted.
  
Recently my academic classes have started and to be honest I really love studing here, specially programming language. And Honestly I have found my those two answer that I was looking for and now I am focusing to develop my skills and knowledge in this sector. This github account is a part of my journey which will track the journey from the beggining untill my success in sha Allah! Thanks for your time reading this long paragraph.
