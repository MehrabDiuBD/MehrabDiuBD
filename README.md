**My Life, Journey, and Aspirations: A Reflective Summary**

Hi, I'm Mehrab Hossain Rahi, was born and raised in the only island district of Bangladesh, named Bhola. After completing my secondary school there, I moved to the capital city Dhaka for better opportunities and education. I was admitted to Dhaka City College then and started exploring the new environment and culture of the capital. After completing my higher secondary school from there, I was preparing for my undergraduate university entrance exams to get into a government-funded university known as public university, which were very competitive exams! Unfortunately, I did not succeed in being placed in the required merit position in those exams which were required by the university.

I started exploring different things on the internet and discovered myself interested in business & entrepreneurship. afterward, I started brainstorming about choosing the industry, where I would like to contribute and pursue my entrepreneurial journey. During that time I have learned that scalability is a major indicator to build a large enterprise, and technology, or to be more specific SAAS has the opportunity to scale a company very fast compared to other industries. Besides, in this industry, starting a business requires comparatively less initial capital than other industries. So I decided to choose this industry to pursue my entrepreneurial journey. However, there was a serious concern that would I be interested and qualified enough to adjust myself in this industry. To find those two answers I decided to do a deep dive into it.

After my entrance exam session had been over and I did not succeed in getting into any public university. My family asked me what I would like to do afterward. I said to them that I would like to pursue my higher education in computer science & engineering and they agreed with me. Then I decided to enroll in Daffodil International University for my bachelor's in CSE and got admitted.
  
Recently my academic classes have started and to be honest I love studying here, especially programming language. Honestly, I have found those two answers that I was looking for and now I am focusing on developing my skills and knowledge in this sector. This GitHub account is a part of my journey which will track the journey from the beginning until my success in sha Allah! Thanks for your time reading this long paragraph.
